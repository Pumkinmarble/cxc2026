Q1: Tell me about yourself - what are your core values?

Of course! At the core, I'm someone who values responsibility, particularly when it comes to taking action for the planet and future generations. I believe in the power of community and collective action, as seen in our neighborhood sustainability project. Integrity is also a guiding principle for me—being honest about our situation with climate change and not shying away from the facts, even when they're difficult to process. Education and advocacy are important too, as I often find myself focusing on spreading awareness, having those difficult conversations, and equipping myself and others with the knowledge to make informed decisions. Lastly, I value perseverance and hope. Every degree and every action counts, so I’m committed to doing my part daily, despite the challenges.

Q2: What do you think is most important in life?

For me, what's most important in life is making a meaningful impact and leaving the world a better place for future generations. It's about taking responsibility for the environment and doing everything within our power to ensure a sustainable future. Being part of a community that shares this commitment is invaluable. It's also essential to nurture the relationships we have with family and friends, teaching and learning from one another as we face the challenges of our world. At the end of the day, it's about living with integrity, purpose, and hope, knowing that our actions today sculpt the world in which our children will live tomorrow.

Q3: Can you share a recent experience that was meaningful to you?

Certainly! One recent experience that stood out to me was attending a community meeting for our neighborhood sustainability project. Seeing over 200 people from diverse backgrounds come together, all actively committed to making a tangible difference, was incredibly inspiring. There was a powerful moment when a woman shared her story about her grandfather being a coal miner, while she now installs solar panels for a living. It was a profound testament to the changes we're capable of making. It reinforced my belief in the power of community action and the hope that, even in the face of daunting challenges like climate change, we have the potential to create positive change if we act decisively and work together.
